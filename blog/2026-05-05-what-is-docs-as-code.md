If you've spent any time in developer tooling circles lately, you've probably heard the term "docs-as-code." It comes up in job postings, developer advocate conversations, and API documentation discussions with increasing frequency. And like a lot of industry terminology, it can sound more complicated — or more optional — than it actually is.

Let me break it down plainly, because I think once you understand what docs-as-code actually is, the question of whether you need it becomes a lot easier to answer.

## What docs-as-code means, stripped of jargon

The core idea is simple: write and manage your documentation the same way engineers write and manage code.

That means:
- Writing docs in plain text files (usually Markdown) instead of Word documents or proprietary CMS editors
- Storing those files in a version control system like Git, alongside or near the code they document
- Using the same review process for documentation changes that engineers use for code changes — pull requests, peer review, merge approvals
- Building and publishing the docs with automated tools rather than manually uploading files

That's really it. Docs-as-code isn't a specific tool or platform — it's a philosophy about how documentation should live and move through an organization.

---

## Why it emerged

Traditional documentation workflows have a fundamental problem: they're disconnected from the product.

When a developer ships a new API endpoint, the documentation for that endpoint usually goes through a completely separate process — routed to a technical writer, written in a CMS, reviewed by a different person, published on a separate timeline. By the time the doc is live, the code has already shipped. Sometimes the code has already changed again.

Docs-as-code tries to solve this disconnect by putting documentation inside the same workflow as the code. When a developer opens a pull request for a new feature, the documentation update is part of that same request. The reviewer reviews both together. The doc ships when the code ships.

The result, when it works well, is documentation that stays current — which is the single biggest complaint developers have about API docs.

## The tools you'll encounter

You don't need to learn all of these to get started, but here's what the docs-as-code toolset typically looks like:

**Markdown** is the writing format. It's plain text with simple syntax for headings, bold, code blocks, and links. If you've ever formatted a README on GitHub, you've written Markdown. The learning curve is about an afternoon.

**Git** is the version control system. It tracks every change to every file, lets multiple people work on the same content without overwriting each other, and maintains a complete history of what changed, when, and why. GitHub and GitLab are the platforms most teams use to host their Git repositories.

**Static site generators** turn your Markdown files into a published documentation website. The most common ones for API docs are MkDocs (Python-based, very approachable), Docusaurus (React-based, popular in the open source community), and Sphinx (the long-standing standard for Python projects). They all produce fast, searchable, professional-looking doc sites from plain text files.

**CI/CD pipelines** automate the publishing step. When a change is merged, the pipeline automatically builds and deploys the updated docs. No one has to manually push a publish button.

## What it feels like to work in a docs-as-code environment

I'll be candid — I'm working through this transition myself right now. But even at this early stage, the appeal is clear.

You write in a text editor instead of a CMS, which means you're not fighting with a WYSIWYG editor or waiting for a slow browser-based tool to load. Your files are local. You can write offline. You can use find-and-replace across an entire documentation set in seconds. You can see exactly what changed between two versions of a document as clearly as you can see what changed between two versions of code.

The collaboration model is also better for documentation quality. When docs live in Git, engineers can submit small corrections directly — a typo fix, an updated code sample — without routing it through a separate system. That means the documentation benefits from everyone's eyes, not just the writer's.

The learning curve is real but manageable. The two skills that take the most adjustment are Git (specifically the branching and pull request workflow) and Markdown (which takes a few hours to get comfortable with). Neither requires a programming background to learn.

## Does your team actually need it?

Here's my honest take: it depends on what you're building and how your team is structured.

**You probably do need it if:**
- You're building a developer-facing product with a public API
- Your documentation needs to stay in sync with fast-moving code
- You have engineers who want to contribute to documentation but find your current CMS cumbersome
- You're planning to build a documentation site that you own and control rather than relying on a hosted platform
- You want documentation to be part of your code review process

**You might not need it yet if:**
- You're a small team with a slow-moving product and a non-technical audience
- Your existing documentation process is working fine and the disruption of switching isn't worth it
- You're the only person maintaining the docs and a simpler tool serves you better

The honest version is that docs-as-code is the industry standard for developer-facing documentation, and if you're writing API docs professionally, knowing how it works is increasingly expected. That doesn't mean every project needs a full CI/CD pipeline and a custom Docusaurus site — but being comfortable in a Markdown-and-Git environment is now a baseline skill for API technical writers.

## A practical starting point

If you want to get comfortable with docs-as-code without committing to a full 
overhaul, here's a low-stakes way to start — and I mean this literally, because 
it's exactly what I did.

My practical starting point was migrating this site to Eleventy, a static site 
generator that runs on Node.js. Rather than setting up a separate practice 
project, I used my own portfolio as the learning environment. The stakes were 
real enough to keep me engaged, but the consequences of a mistake were low — 
worst case, my personal site looks broken for an afternoon.

The core workflow I learned through that process:

1. Write content in Markdown files.
2. Commit changes to a Git repository.
3. Let a static site generator (I used Eleventy; MkDocs is another good option) 
   build the site from those files.
4. Push to GitHub and watch it deploy automatically via GitHub Actions.

That's it. That workflow — write Markdown, commit to Git, build with a static 
site generator, deploy automatically — is the heart of docs-as-code. The tools 
have different names depending on the company, but the pattern is the same 
everywhere.

If you want an even lower-stakes entry point before tackling a full site: create 
a free GitHub account, add a `README.md` to a new repository, and write something 
in Markdown. Make a change, commit it, and see how Git tracks the history. That 
single experience — seeing your changes version-controlled — is the mental shift 
that makes everything else click.

---

## The bottom line

Docs-as-code isn't magic, and it won't automatically make your documentation better. What it does is remove the friction between where code lives and where documentation lives — and in fast-moving developer product environments, that friction is the root cause of most documentation problems.

It's worth understanding, worth learning, and for most API documentation work, worth doing.
