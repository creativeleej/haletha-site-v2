Developer experience research consistently shows the same thing: documentation is the number one factor developers cite when evaluating whether to adopt an API. More than pricing. More than performance. More than feature set. That means your documentation is doing sales work whether you think of it that way or not. Good docs lower the barrier to adoption. Bad docs send developers straight to a competitor.

After decades of writing, reviewing, and — yes — reading a lot of API documentation, I've noticed that the same mistakes come up again and again. They're rarely caused by carelessness. They're usually caused by writers and teams who are too close to their own product to see it the way a stranger would.

Here are the five I see most often, and what to do instead.

---

## 1. Documenting for the team that built the product, not the developer who's new to it

This is the most common mistake, and it's an easy trap to fall into.

When you work on a product every day, you stop noticing the things that are confusing to someone encountering it for the first time. The internal nickname for a core object becomes the name you use in the docs without explanation. The reason a certain endpoint works the way it does is obvious to you because you were in the room when the architecture decision was made — but it's completely opaque to an outside developer.

The fix is to put fresh eyes on your documentation regularly. Recruit someone who has never seen the API — ideally a developer, but even a non-technical colleague — and watch them try to complete a task using only your docs. The places where they get stuck are the places your documentation is failing.

Better yet, hire a technical writer who doesn't know your product. Not knowing it isn't a disadvantage — it's the qualification.

## 2. Burying the quickstart

I have a personal rule when I'm evaluating API documentation: if I can't make a successful API call within ten minutes using only the docs, the documentation has failed.

Most developers approach a new API the same way. They're not starting with the reference docs. They're looking for the shortest possible path to "it works" — a moment of success that validates the integration is worth continuing.

If your quickstart is buried three levels deep in the navigation, requires the developer to read five conceptual sections before they get to a single line of code, or isn't present at all, you're losing developers before they've had a chance to see what your product can do.

The fix: make the quickstart the first thing in your navigation. Start with authentication and one working call. Get the developer to a successful response in under ten minutes. Save the deep conceptual material for later — they'll read it once they've already decided the API is worth their time.

## 3. Example responses that don't reflect real responses

This one is subtle but corrosive to developer trust.

When a developer looks at your example response, they're building a mental model of what they'll receive in production. If that example is oversimplified, uses fields that don't actually appear in responses, or omits fields that the real response includes, the developer gets a wrong mental model. They write code against your example. Their code breaks in production. They lose trust in your documentation — and in your product.

I've seen this happen because a developer hand-wrote an example response without testing it against the actual API. I've seen it happen because the API changed and the documentation didn't. I've seen it happen because the example was written to be clean and readable rather than accurate.

The fix: example responses should come from actual API calls. Use a tool like Postman, copy a real response, anonymize any sensitive values, and use that. Automate the process if you can — some doc toolchains can generate examples from live API calls and keep them in sync with the actual responses.

## 4. Error documentation that tells you what happened but not what to do

A developer who hits a `429 Too Many Requests` error at 2am, with a production integration down, needs two things immediately: to understand what went wrong, and to know exactly what to do next.Most error documentation handles the first part reasonably well. It fails consistently at the second.

I've worked closely with engineers and developers throughout my career, and at two enterprise software companies — one focused on association management software, one on data integration tools. I was involved in creating the error handling documentation from the ground up — sitting with the engineering team to understand not just what each error meant, but what a developer would actually need to do when they encountered it. That experience shaped how I think about this problem.

"Rate limit exceeded" tells the developer what happened. It does not tell them what their rate limit is, how to check their current usage, whether the limit resets hourly or daily, what the `Retry-After` header value means, or how to 
implement an exponential backoff strategy. All of that is what they actually need.

The fix: for every error in your documentation, write at minimum: what the error means, the most common causes, and the recommended action. For rate limit and authentication errors specifically, include a code example showing how to handle the error gracefully. That code example will be copy-pasted into production by hundreds of developers. It's worth the ten minutes it takes to write it well.

## 5. Using "simple," "easy," and "just" — the three most dangerous words in API docs

These three words have cost developers hours of frustrated debugging. I try to eliminate them entirely from any documentation I write.

"Simply add the Authorization header." Except it's not simple if you don't know what format the token needs to be in, where to get it, or how to handle the case where it expires.

"Just pass the user ID." Except the user ID is a UUID in some contexts and an integer in others, depending on how the account was created, and that's not obvious from the documentation.

"This is an easy integration." Except the developer reading this has been stuck for three hours and now they feel like the problem is their own competence rather than incomplete documentation.

The problem with these words is that they're written from the perspective of someone who already knows how to do the thing. They communicate confidence to the writer and condescension to the reader.

The fix: replace them with specificity. Instead of "simply add the Authorization header," write "Add an `Authorization` header with the value `Bearer {your_api_key}`, where `{your_api_key}` is the key from your dashboard under Settings > API Keys." That sentence takes three seconds longer to write and saves an untold number of support tickets.

## A note on fixing these mistakes

None of these problems require a documentation overhaul to fix. They require a fresh perspective and a commitment to writing for the reader rather than for yourself.

The most useful thing you can do right now: go to your own API documentation and try to complete a basic integration using only what's written there. Not using your memory. Not using internal tools. Just the documentation, the way a stranger would experience it.

What you find will tell you everything about where to start.
